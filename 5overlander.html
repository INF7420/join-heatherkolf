      <p>"Gregor’s luminous, supremely absorbing quest takes place in a strange underground land of giant cockroaches, rideable bats, and violet-eyed humans... Creature depictions are soulful and the plot is riveting... Wonderful.”<br />
      &#8210Kirkus reviews, STARRED REVIEW</p>

      <p>"Collins does a grand job of world-building, with a fine economy of words…Unlike Gregor, who cannot wait to leave, readers will likely find [the Underland] to be a fantastically engaging place.”<br />
      &#8210Publishers Weekly, STARRED REVIEW</p>

      <p>"[An} exceptional debut novel, a well-written, fast-moving, action-packed fantasy... [S]ure to be a solid hit with young fantasy fans.”<br />
      &#8210Booklist, STARRED REVIEW</p>

      <p>"A refreshing combination of sensitive characters, innovative devices, and an unusual setting make this an appealing purchase for younger fantasy fans."<br />
      &#8210VOYA</p>

      <p>"This is an engrossing adventure for fantasy fans and for those new to the genre."<br />
      &#8210School Library Journal</p>

      <p>"The fast-paced, detailed narrative features vivid battle scenes (complete with gore), dangerous alliances, some frighteningly close calls, and the sobering death of comrades-in-arms. Cliffhanger chapter endings propel the story forward to its inevitable but nevertheless immensely satisfying conclusion, which, happily for readers, hints at more heart-pounding journeys to the center of the earth."<br />
