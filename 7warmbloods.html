    <p>"This immensely readable installment won’t disappoint fans of the first two books... Character development, plotting, pacing, and description all shine; suspenseful chapter endings propel the story forward to its shocking and sobering conclusion.”<br />
      &#8210The Horn Book Magazine</p>

    <p>"Collins maintains the momentum, charm, and vivid settings of the original title. The characterizations continue to be complex with each new book, revealing new sides to familiar individuals. Fans of this inventive series and new readers alike will be instantly caught up in the action and will look forward to future installments."<br />
      &#8210School Library Journal</p>

    <p>"The strong, likeable characters, easy reading level, and nonstop action make this series attractive to even reluctant readers."<br />
      &#8210VOYA</p>

    <p>"Collins keeps the plot moving at warp speed and includes just enough background to bring readers up to speed on the multitude of characters and the political rivalries that unite and divide them. This offering takes on an even darker tone than the earlier ones, delving into meaty questions of territorial expansion and its justification. Although no further prophecy is unveiled at the end to explicitly promise another sequel, readers will surely be hoping for one."<br />
      &#8210Kirkus Reviews</p>

    <p>"The addition of the mother adds a fresh dynamic to the fast-paced, suspenseful story. Fans of the series will enjoy this latest, skillfully told adventure."<br />
