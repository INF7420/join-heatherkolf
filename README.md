# My INF 7420 Project

I am going to redesign an author profile page. The main purpose of this project will be to improve the existing website for author Suzanne Collins.

## Wireframes

I value planning, so here are some wireframes to show possible site architecture and layout.

### **Home Page:**

Header - will include the navigation menu and author's name

Navigation Menu - will include links to main pages

Main Content - will include a welcome message from the author along with links to most recent books and news stories

Footer - will include links to contact info, privacy policy, and terms of service, along with copyright info

### **Bio Page:**
